Team Members: **Ethan Bechtel, Lilly Marletta**

## What does this System do? 
This system will implement the windshield wipers of a car. The user will have access to 4 different modes: OFF, LOW, HIGH, and INTERMITTENT. INTERMITTENT will allow the user to adjust how often the windshield wipers cycle. This is the wiper delay. The current mode and current wiper Delay will be displayed on the LCD. The engine must be turned on to operate the windshield wipers. To turn the engine on, the driver must be sitting and press and release the ignition button. 
### Mode Selection

LOW: The windshield wipers will cycle at a slow rate: ~0.8 times per second <br>
HIGH: The windshield wipers will cycle at a fast rate: ~1.2 times per second <br>
INTERMITTENT: The windshield wipers will cycle at a slow rate and the user will be able to select a delay period
### Delay Selection
SHORT: The windshiled wipers will cycle every 3 seconds <br>
